## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by a [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [panieravide@riseup.net](mailto:panieravide@riseup.net).


## Reporting Bugs

If you encountered an unexpected behaviour in the editor, or want to share your awesome ideas, please feel free to [open an issue](https://framagit.org/PanierAvide/osminedit/issues) on this repository. Before doing so, you might have a look at existing issues to see if you can join discussion instead.


## Translate the application

We use Transifex, which is a simple platform for translating applications. We have all the [labels there](https://www.transifex.com/openlevelup/osminedit), in English, so you can write translations into your language. Let us know when you're done, that way we will update the application to make your language available.

If you run into any issue for doing this (like your language isn't available in the list), please [contact us](mailto:panieravide@riseup.net) or [open an issue](https://framagit.org/PanierAvide/osminedit/issues/new).


## Develop feature, offer pull requests

If you are a developer, you can see the [list of open issues](https://framagit.org/PanierAvide/osminedit/issues) and start working on one of them. To start development, please read [development documentation](DEVELOP.md). When you think your work is done, you can open a pull request, so we can integrate your contribution in the editor.
